Grading of invasive carcinoma is based on the modified Bloom-Richardson system as described in Protocol for the Examination of Specimens from Patients with Invasive Carcinoma of the Breast, a publication of the College of American Pathologists (CAP), updated on 2009.  The TNM staging is based on the recommendations of the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC, 7th Edition, 2010).
